/*
WHAT'S TYPESCRIPT AND WHY TO USE?

=> What'is:
   - "Typescript is Javascript with type syntax"
   - It's a programming language
   - It's a Javascript superset, it means, it's a language build on top of Javascript
   - Every valid Javascript code is valid Typescript code
   - The relationship between Ts and Js can be seen as that of SCSS and CSS
   - It's a strongly and static typed language

=> Why Use?
   - After getting used to using, it increases your productivity
   - Allows your IDE to get "smarter", for example, showing errors and options with autocomplete
   - Allows you to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
   - Reduced learning curve, as it uses Js syntax and it is possible to adopt Ts gradually and partially
   - Brings extra features that don't exists in Js, how tuples, enums, best support to OOP, etc

=> When Use?
   - Ts is specially advantageous in large projects
   - For being a Js superset, it's important that you already have a good knowledge of it
   - Even in a project written in Ts, it's necessary know when to use your features
