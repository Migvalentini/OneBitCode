/*
PRIMITIVE TYPES:

=> Just like in Js, the primitive types are the most basic and most used
=> Are the ones you can normally get using the typeof operator
=> There are three most used:
   - Boolean: true or false
      let example: boolean = true
   - Number: int and float
      let example: number = 10
   - String: texts
      let example: string = 'Hello World"
=> In addition, we also have the Array, that represents the data lists:
   - The simple syntax for specify an array is using the type of your elements. For example, string[] or number[]
      let example: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      let example:  Array<number> = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   - Ideally we use arrays being a list where all elements are of the same type, but this behavior can also be avoided
