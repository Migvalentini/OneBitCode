REACT COMPONENTS:

=> Components are small blocks that compose an interface
=> Unlike HTML, where we write the entire page to a file, components defines small blocks that are reused and extensible
=> Vantages:
   - Can be written once and reused many time easily
   - Speed up the process of modifying a specific part of the interface
   - Makes the structure of a project more organized, with each file responsible for a small part
=> function Button() {
=>    return <button>My Button</button>
=> }

=> function Container() {
=>    return (
=>       <div className="">
=>          <h1></h1>
=>          <p></p>
=>       </div>
=>    )
=> }
