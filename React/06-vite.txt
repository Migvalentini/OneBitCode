VITE:

=> It is a framework that help us to build web applications
=> Is composed of two main parts:
   - A development server that works with ESM to supply Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
   - A packer (Rollup) that comes pre-configured to generate optimized assets to production
=> It is like webpack, but it is a solution more recommended currently:
   - Faster
   - Simpler
=> To create a project with Vite just run 'npm create vite@latest'
