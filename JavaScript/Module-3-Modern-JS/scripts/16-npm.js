NPM:

=> Npm means node package manager
=> Obs: Node.js is a tool that allows you to run javascript outside the browser
=> Why does the npm exists?
    - Share our modules with others programmers
    - Allows we share our modules in the internet, download modules to our project and manage the downloaded modules in our project
    - Open-source community power allows we increase our productivity (DRY, Don't repeat yourself)
=> Npm can be seen as 3 features that work together:
    - An command line tool to run npm
    - An online repository package, where the modules that we can download are downloaded
    - The https://npmjs.com where we can to browse exiting modules in the repository
