/*
FEATURE COMPATIBILITY:

=> Javascript features need to be implemented by the browser and its interpreters for they to work
=> However, the browsers can take a while to implement thew Javascript update features (or may never implement them)
=> This creates the problem that nre Javascript features are not always available in browsers (ex: Internet Explorer)
=> To know more about feature compatibility we have two main sources:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/Javascript (pt-br)
