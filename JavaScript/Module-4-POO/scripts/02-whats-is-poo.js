/*
WHAT'S POO:

=> It is a programming paradigm, that is a set of concepts and language features that guide the way we program
=> Has as a centerpiece the objects and the way they communicate
=> The objects can contain data (attributes) and code (methods)
=> Two another important terms are classes and instances:
=> Classes are the set of methods that are available to the objects:
    - Classes are like factories of an object from a 'shape'
    - Instances are the objects factories by the class
